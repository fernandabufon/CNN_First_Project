## CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN

This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists 32x32 colored images separated into 10 classes. The classes include airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

### Project Details
The model features two convolutional layers, which are crucial for extracting detailed features from images, essential for effective classification. The preprocessing steps include normalizing the pixel values to a range of 0 to 1, enhancing the neural network's performance.

### Learning Objective
The project was a practical exercise to learn about the workings and implementation of convolutional neural networks. It follows a tutorial by CodeBasics, which is aimed at beginners looking to get started with CNNs in TensorFlow.
